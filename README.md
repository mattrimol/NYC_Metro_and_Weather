# NYC Metro and Weather

This is an exploratory data analysis of how subway traffic changes at certain stations during inclement weather events or changes in temperature. Using data from the NYC MTA and National Weather Service, I cleaned the data and merged the two datasets so that I could perform EDA over the time period from January 1 to June 30 2016.
